            How to prepare Mawa (Khoya)?
            Follow the below given steps to prepare mawa or follow the given link for homemade mawa recipe with step by step photos.
            Boil 1 liter milk (preferably full cream buffalo milk) in a heavy based pan or non-stick pan and cook over low flame until it turns very thick and there is no liquid left anymore, for around 1½ hours. Stir in between frequently to prevent sticking. Approx. 1 cup mawa will be prepared from 1 liter milk(use of full cream milk is recommended).
            Note: If you do not want to prepare mawa at home, you can buy it from any Indian stores (if you are outside India) or from dairy store (if you are in India).
